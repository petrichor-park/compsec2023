I. Metasploitable's * gateway is 172.16.239/23, so anything where the first 23
   bits match will go to the gateway; it looks like it'll be specifically
   sending things to 172.16.239.2 by default.
J. I get an HTTP response on Metasploitable and I can see the whole transaction
   on Kali.
K. It looks like quite a few addresses in 10.133.128.0/20 are being filled with
   Kali's MAC.
M. My guess is that it'll go "aha! Gateway time, gotta send this packet to the
   gateway -- oh look at that, another helpful computer on the network says
   the gateway is [Kali's MAC address]!" and send it there. Silly computer.
N. Check.
O. Yes, I got the HTTP response and I see Wireshark packets... but it doesn't
   look like the ARP spoofing worked. The original SYN packet's Ethernet frame
   is sending to b4:0c:etc which is not Kali's MAC.
   Turning off the spoofing though, the MAC addresses quickly go back to being
   all different...
   I'm really not sure what's happening, because Metasploitable says that it
   thinks the gateway is Kali, but Wireshark says that all the packets are
   just being sent to the gateway...
P. Whenever anyone on the network sends out an ARP message asking "What MAC is
   associated with IP addr X?" Kali responds "Oh, it's me!" and sends out its
   MAC.
Q. It might be possible to check if a suspiciously large number of IP addresses
   you query all point to the same MAC address... but I can imagine some
   situations (like company intranet, or a VPN) where that is actually intended
   behavior. (I do note that Wireshark prints some warning messages when it
   detects that more than one IP address point with the same MAC.)
   I suppose that it's just best to assume someone could be listening and
   encrypt all your traffic.

=== Synthesis ===

A. Mal wants to trick Alice into sending traffic to her instead of Bob, and
   then send the packets through to Bob to avoid him getting suspiscious. To
   trick Alice, when Alice asks "hey, how do I send packets out to the rest of
   the world?" Mal says "OH YOU GO HERE TO MY COMPUTER I PROMISE." (I'm not
   sure why Alice listens to Mal and not the actual gateway, but my guess is
   that Mal just sends more packets in the hope Alice finds hers' first.) Then
   Alice's computer records "to send packets to the gateway, send them to
   [Mal's MAC address]" instead of the real gateway's MAC address.
B. She could probably *guess* that something's up if a suspiciously large
   number of ARP packets are going over the network, or if she asks for a bunch
   of random IPs and they all point to one MAC. But again I don't think there's
   really a foolproof way to do this.
C. Not just with the packets. All Bob sees is "someone from this network sent
   me a packet."
D. I don't think they could tell, still. All it does is make it so Mal can't do
   anything with the packets they're sending. She can't read them, and if she
   tries to modify them, then the recipient will know.

I don't have a satisfying answer for how come ARP poisoning doesn't just
immediately DoS the whole network. I suppose it's very easy to detect that it's
happening, but it would probably be pretty hard to find the device that's doing
the attack on a large network.
