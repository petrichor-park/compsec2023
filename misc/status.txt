I don't have Kali set up yet because Mike Tie hasn't sent out the emails. I have
used it before years ago though.

I'm doing this all on a clean Github account because I don't want people to be
able to find out where I go to college from my normal Github account.

By the way I've "fixed" the problems with accessing the course website by
SSH'ing into Mirage and then using Lynx from there. Dear lord.
