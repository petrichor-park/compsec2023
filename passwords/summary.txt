Interestingly it looks like old students are also in the passwd on mirage: I see
`wormanm` and `stockwella`, who are alumni. I can't read shadow, though, which
is probably good. I do wonder if this means, if I can get an "old" password out
of an alumnus, if I can break into Mirage.

Anyways.

Run things with `cargo run --release -- ARGS`
ARGS can be
- part1
- part2 {target-hash-count}

=== Part 1 ===

User time : 211ms
Hashes computed : 267516
Passwords cracked : 2734 (hell yeah)
Time per hash : 0.78 microseconds
Time per crack : 77 microseconds

There's about 100 times more words than users, so it makes sense it would take
about 1/100th of the time to do each hash vs each password.

=== Part 2 ===

I'm using Rayon for parallelism, which automatically splits up my processing
across threads ... but this means I can't write to a file in real time.
So, I'm going to just tell the computer to stop after it gets 50 passwords.
